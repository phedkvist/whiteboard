# Todo list

## Current task

- [Â ] Add support for several rooms

Need endpoint for creating a new room.
Get a uuid that maps to the room.
Then you should be able to connect to the room.

Either the UUID is created by the user or a request is made so that the room is created by the server.
Doing the former is more of a local first approach.

Once connected to a room, the sync class either all changes in memory, or if it doesn't, has to fetch all changes from db. Should the sync class always be instantiated or should it always keep things in memory.

Stateless vs stateful?

Stateful requires one server to be "active".
Stateless requires something lik
